# Rule: User-Facing Toasts

For any component that users interact with or that displays feedback:
- Use toasts instead of console.log or API error logs
- Messages must be friendly and understandable for end users
- Never display technical logs, stack traces, or raw API error messages
- Examples of good messages: "Saved successfully", "Error loading data. Please try again.", "Please fill in all required fields"
- Use appropriate variants: success, error, warning, info
